# Jeopardy Workshop
The source code for https://jeopardyworkshop.com, which is a website to easily create, review, and edit your custom jeopardy board.
I use a node module called cheerio to edit and modify html on the fly in the server. 
To deploy the server, I use balenaCloud with a Raspberry Pi 3 running balenaOS. This is the reason I use docker.
